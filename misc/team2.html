<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4>

<p>Ethical Concerns are very important when dealing with a topic such as Automation and its relation to society. Especially when A.I. do not have a sense of humanity in them in a sense that they cannot make decisions from a human perspective. In retrospect, these A.I's do not have consciousness and shouldn't be in place of making decisions that have human lives and great consequences on the line.</p>
<p>Another thing that Automation in Society impacts is taking over repetitive jobs. With this in mind, unemployement could become a bigger issue. As A.I. keeps developing the better they can get and therefore, in the future they could be replacing most of the repetetive, mundane jobs which can then branch onto larger societal issues. An example could be is that emloyees who have lost their job could become in debt, homeless and with this mind, higher crime-rates could come about. Hypothetically, with automation replacing most jobs, the money saved by reduced expense towards human labour could instead be pocketed by corrupt governments as compared to spending the money to make the country better.</p>  	
<p>A benefit that could come from this however is that since A.I is taking over jobs, this can reduce human labour in a good sense and can open up doors for jobs to be able to know how to program the said AI's.</p>
<p>In terms of Automation in Society, I am very keen to see what could happen to our society if we started to implement AI here and there. I believe this could helps us, but I also think there is that line that shouldn't be crossed in which it could be unethical.</p>
<p>First off, in terms of decision-making within automated systems, I do not think it is a good idea for automated systems (or anything with automation implemented) to make moral decisions. This is because, these things aren't human and have no sense of thought, conscience, humanity or emotion to be able to judge what is right and what is wrong. My recommendation is that we shouldn't put automated systems in positions where they're even considered being implemented into these situations and most of all, they shouldn't be placed in position to make decisions, in which a human usually would. At the same time when talking about self-driving, we HAVE to give them some form of AI because if they didn't have any then that would put the lives of every one around it, at risk.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think Automation in Society is a hard topic with many pros and cons that make it hard to make a recommendation.
