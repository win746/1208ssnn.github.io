<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations</h2>
<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4>
<p>One of the ethical concerns regarding automation and its relation to society is already highlighted once in the choices section, but it is regarding the use of automated technology when moral decisions are required. It isn't so much the neverending debates between moralism and utilitarianism, but I think the major issue is regarding whether machines are allowed to partake in the decision making at all.</p>
<p>Another ethical issue is that the major arguments in favour of automation in manufacturing and other production industries is that the reduction of costs and change into robotic workers allow society to benefit from cheaper costs, and that workers in these production lines are shifted to become more educated and specialised in supervising the automated systems. However, questions are raised whether the increase of automation will cause permanent unemployment, as there are just not enough jobs when technology can handle a lot more each passing year.</p>
<p>Regarding these issues, I am always in favour of progress; however, this doesn't mean that society can be carefree in expanding automation.</p>
<p>For the first concern, this means that I don't think it is a good idea for automated vehicles, or any kind of automated systems to make moral decisions. My justification is that moral decisions are derived from experiences, values, and disposition of a person, though mainly experience. Experience in the sense of an impression that was left on someone, and the sense where knowledge of skill acquired by the person. Programming procedures for an automated system to decide moral decisions just means that the program's will is actually the programmer's will. This, however, doesn't mean that the programmer will be responsible for the consequence of the decision, nor should it be.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to not give automated systems the power or ability to make these decisions. However, it is quite naive as it couldn't be so simple to not make a decision, especially for automated vehicles. Another recommendation then is to not even put automated systems into these kind of situations in the first place; in other words, don't have automated vehicles, or any automated systems should never have a chance to stumble upon moral decisions at all. This should be left to the device of humans.</p>
<p>The other concern regarding unemployment and such, I think that in an ideal world the automation of more and more jobs and processes is a good idea. The idea is that it will allow cheaper production, producing more amenities, and allowing expenses to be redirected to other things like welfare and education, allowing workers to move on to more rewarding jobs. But the real world works differently, and the issue becomes less towards automation and more towards how society works. As more jobs become automated, money saved by the reduced expense and increased productivity didn't mean the money is being spent, instead mostly pocketed. There are also not much idea in society to create new jobs, especially if it is not profitable.</p>
<p>That said, a recommendation for this is difficult. The issue isn't new to automation; the first industrial revolution resulted in steam-powered equipment that made a lot of jobs redundant, and automation isn't any different. Society wouldn't stop automation for the sake of workers, as it is counter-productive. A meagre recommendation would be to invest in education and hopefully allow more people to go into higher level work that cannot be automated.</p>
