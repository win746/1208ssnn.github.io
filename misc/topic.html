	  <p>Automation is generally described as a technology that enables a process to perform proper execution of commands using automatic feedback control, allowing the system to operate with minimal or no human intervention (Groover, 2020).  </p>
      <p>Automation is somewhere between the Third and Fourth Industrial Revolution. The First Industrial Revolution started with mechanization of industry using steam power. The Second concerns with the invention of electrical power, and the Third is the digital revolution (Schwab, 2016). The Fourth Revolution is the continuation of the Third, through use of Artificial Intelligence. Automation has started with manufacturing, with production lines using machines to assemble the same type of product, with line workers overseeing the production. </p>
	  <p>Starting with the First Revolution, each age brought along an economic growth globally, due to rapid increase in production and quality. Along with economic boom, the nature of work also changed, as routine jobs are replaced with machines manned by production line workers. Automation is compared to the results of the First Revolution, as latest machines can perform routine tasks with little to no input, changing the world similarly to how steam-powered machines did. (Susskind, 2020). </p>

      <h4>Lower operating costs</h4>
	  <p>Robots can perform the work of three to five people, depending on the task. In addition to savings on the cost of labor, energy savings can also be significant due to lower heating requirements in automated operations. Robots streamline processes and increase part accuracy, which means minimal material waste for your operation.</p>
	  <h4>Increased production output</h4>
	  <p>A robot has the ability to work at a constant speed, unattended, 24/7. That means you’ve got the potential to produce more. New products can be more quickly introduced into the production process and new product programming can be done offline with no disruption to existing processes.</p>
	  <h4>Maximize labor</h4>
	  <p>Over the next three decades, statistics show that more than 76 million baby boomers will retire and only 46 million new workers will be available to replace them. During this time, your demand for labor will continue, making automation a real and viable solution.</p>
