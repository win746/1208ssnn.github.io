      <p>One of the purposes for adopting automation technology by sectors such as manufacturing is to perform tasks with higher degree of accuracy and efficiency, and most importantly, lower costs than human operators (Frohm, Lindstrom, Winroth, & Stahre, 2006). </p>

      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p>Human workers have associated downsides that can be negated with introduction of automated systems. One of the issues is the stress and fatigue associated with typical manufacturing jobs. The job may be menial and monotonous or require high level of focus with little room for mistakes. Use of automated systems can also reduce chance of human error (Breton & Bosse, 2003). </p>
    <p>Outside the realm of manufacturing, automation has been applied to vehicles, enabling the use of self-driving, autonomous vehicles. Fully automated vehicles are still in early stages of concept and development, mostly a prototype, but vehicles such as Tesla allows for automated driving. There are claims in favour of automated vehicles that it eliminates the risks of driver error, allowing for faster reaction time due to the nature of computers’ computational ability. It also eliminates driver costs, which is beneficial for ride-sharing initiatives and for the broader transportation service (Gurumurthy, Kockelman, & Simoni, 2019). </p>
