<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>

<p>The ethics of AI and robotics has seen significant press coverage in recent years. As There’s a worry amongst workforces that bots are taking our jobs. Known as automation anxiety, more and more teams are falling foul of the fear that they too will soon find themselves replaced by automation. There is also fear that they may end up undermining it: as the press often talks as if the issues under discussion were just predictions of what future technology will bring, and as though we already know what would be most ethical and how to achieve that. Current discussions in policy and industry are also motivated by image and public relations, where the label “ethical” is really not much more than the new “green”, perhaps used for “ethics washing”. For a problem to qualify as a problem for AI ethics would require that we do not readily know what the right thing to do is. In this sense, job loss, theft, or killing with AI is not a problem in ethics, but whether these are permissible under certain circumstances is a problem.
</p>
<p>Automated decisions / AI bias is a major ethical issue in today's world where robotics and self driving AI are getting introduced to society. Today's AI is fed big data that are collected through different ways and their decision relies on the data that has been collected. For example drivers make a lot of moral decisions when they are driving and could this moral decision be the same with the self driving, people from different place and different culture have different ethical and moral views like some people may want to save young people over old ones in other place they might want to save old people over young ones. 
</p>
<P>The other ethical issue is the misuses of AI  Surveillance practices limiting privacy. This is disturbing. Trying to identify a person without his/her consent is not acceptable because it breaches the privacy of that individual. I think it should be used only for security purposes, it shouldn't be deployed in a public area because it creates an uncomfortable atmosphere  in which people have to restrain themselves from doing something because they know they are being watched every second.
</p>
<p>While i was doing my research on automation i came to realize that automation is taking over rapidly and as years goes by, almost every if not all factory/manufacturer will operate using automated robots to do their labour work. I can only imagine how it is very frightening for parents that don't have the ideal “future job”  and as automation use is expanding, there will be more people out there struggling to put food on the table and feeling useless to society. If automation does lead to job loss without any kind of alternate income provided, that creates a huge ethical issue. (One that not only affects individuals but threatens to harm society as a whole.). This is catch-22 situation  because the manufacturers want to boost their net profit and this is a great way of doing it because they don't have to take out money from their profit and  pay a labour worker and on the other hand the people who have this kind of job will be jobless so these two are mutually exclusive. They can not both happen at the same time so we have to look for other options and have an early discussion about this whole topic and come up with solutions because we can't force manufacturer to employ labour workers because what the manufacturers produce have an effect on the  economy of a country known that its nearly impossible to discuss this matter with them. 
</p>
<p>I believe that  as companies embrace automation and artificial intelligence, some jobs will be created or enhanced, but many more are likely to go away. This is gonna have an effect on the future generation as they are gonna stumble around choosing on which job is a””future proof” one let alone employed on their dream job. The discussion should start now and we have to focus on what  obligation do organizations have to displaced workers in such situations? Is there an ethical way for business leaders to usher their workforces through digital disruption?
